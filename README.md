# Nylon image analysis
An automated procedure to quantify encapsulation, melanisation and length of nylon monofilaments used in immunological assays.

### Requirements and compilation

The script requires an installation of the Open Source Computer Vision library, [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/quickstart.html.). The script needs to be compiled. For example, using the GNU C++ compiler for Linux:

```g ++ -ggdb `pkg-config --cflags opencv` -o ./nylon ./nylonAnalysis.cpp `pkg-config --libs opencv` ```


### General use
Visually defining the degree of nylon encapsulation is a subjective process, as the user must decide what is areas of the image are sufficiently dark enough to constitute cellular encapsulation. The script therefore requires a brightness threshold to be defined, and the number of pixels in the main contour (the nylon monofilament) below this threshold is counted. Foreground extraction works best when images of the nylon are captured against a lighter, contrasting background.

### Command line usage:

```./PROGRAM_NAME lower_threshold upper_threshold FILE_1 FILE_2 ..```

Where `lower_threshold` equals the desired lower brightness threshold and `upper_threshold` the desired higher threshold **+1**.


#####Examples
When compiled as above, to iterate over all possible brightness thresholds (0-255) for all .jpg images in current directory:

```./nylon 0 256 *.jpg```


To define only one brightness threshold (99) for all .jpg images in current directory:

```./nylon 99 100 *.jpg```


### Calibration
In order to calibrate the assay and choose an appropriate threshold to define encapsulation, we can compare a few manually-calculated encapsulation scores with automatically-calculated encapsulation scores for the same images across all possible brightness thresholds, and find the automated brightness threshold which provides the closest match.

I assayed encapsulation manually using the thresholding tool in open source image analysis software, [ImageJ](http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). The automated threshold iteratation can be performed for example by:

Sample images and an example R script, "calibrateThreshold.R", are provided in the directory  [`nylon/calibration_example/`](https://github.com/JoGall/nylon-encapsulation/tree/master/calibration_example).
